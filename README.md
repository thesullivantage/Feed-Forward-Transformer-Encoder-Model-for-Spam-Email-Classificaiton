# Feed-Forward Transformer Encoder Model for Spam Email Classification

A deep, feed-forward classification model built using text vectorization, custom pre-processing, and a transformer encoder network for spam email classification. 

Designed for a freelance client. Future work will entail refactoring the model in PyTorch and the construction of a pipeline on AWS Sagemaker.
